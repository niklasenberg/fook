A mobile peer-to-peer marketplace for course literature, aimed at students at [DSV, Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/department-of-computer-and-systems-sciences/).

## Description

This application was developed as a group project for the course PVT15, during a ~10 week period, applying the SCRUM framework. The project idea, technologies used and working strategy were all internally developed as part of the project.

The application makes use of a public [API](https://api.dsv.su.se) that supplies the literature for a given course at DSV. The exchange platform was built around this by use of personas, focus groups, extensive user research and testing. The application includes functionality such as:

* Authentication via mail/password
* Version handling of old/current literature
* Real-time chat messaging with push notifications
* Real-time search by course or ISBN
